# Pronotify

Pronote is a school life management software created in 1999 by Index Education, and used in more than 10 000 high schools. It is initially a fat client, but since 2003, there is an extension that allows to use it as a web application: Pronote.net. Since 2008, Pronote is also available as a mobile application. ([Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronote))

While this application is a great way to access your grades on the internet, there is one thing that all French high school students who stress about their grades will tell you:
It lacks a notification system, a way for everyone to have access to their grades when they normally appear on the application.

That's when Pronotify appeared, which, thanks to the [Pronotepy](https://github.com/bain3/pronotepy) and [Telegram](https://core.telegram.org/) APIs, makes the dream of all French high school students come true.
